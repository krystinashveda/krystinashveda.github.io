    <p>As the Syrian city of Kobane keeps resisting the Islamic State’s attacks, a delegation of Kurdish protesters is meeting MPs across London demanding proper help from the British government.</p>

<h4 id="jeremy-corbyn-the-mp-for-north-islington-to-lobby-helping-kurdish-kobane">Jeremy Corbyn, the MP for North Islington, to lobby helping Kurdish Kobane</h4>

<p>Although <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/09/26/us-syria-crisis-coalition-factbox-idUSKCN0HL2DL20140926">the UK has joined International Coalition Against Islamic State</a> and agreed to conduct air strikes over Iraq, the Parliament is reluctant to allow military operations over the territory of Syria, ruled by a hostile President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn, who voted against joining anti-ISIS coalition before its strikes focused on Kobane, committed himself to lobbying support to the Kurdish city at the Parliament during his speech to Kurdish protesters at the Parliament Square on October 14.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Hope MP&#39;s think before Parliamentary vote: Bombing will make the Isis problem worse | <a href="https://twitter.com/guardianletters">@guardianletters</a>&#10; <a href="http://t.co/KxvbGgp46a">http://t.co/KxvbGgp46a</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/guardian">@guardian</a></p>&mdash; Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/514703922968027137">September 24, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The delegates demanded conducting air strikes against ISIS over Kobane, providing armoury to YPG (People’s Protection Units) guerilla fighters who defend the city and convincing Turkey to help Kobane.</p>

<p>“ISIS is growing. Today it’s Kurdistan, tomorrow it can be London,” one of the protesters said. </p>

<p>The protesters chanted “Wake up, UK! Wake up, UK! Turkey is for ISIS!”, asking the UK authorities to influence Turkey <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/turkey-inaction-kobani-kurdish-peace-politics">whose silence they regard as the support for ISIS</a>. Kurdish population has been a sensitive issue for Turkey for decades, since the Kurds used to demand independence. Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) is considered a terrorist body by Turkey, US and EU.</p>

<p>“I am here especially for Kobane. Civilian people are like in a prison there, being attacked by ISIS from 3 sides and by Turkey on the other side. Women die, children have no food. Please, help us,” another protester begged.</p>

<h4 id="jeremy-corbyn-mp-to-push-demands-on-turkey">Jeremy Corbyn MP to push demands on Turkey</h4>

<p>In his speech to protesters, Corbyn said that he would try to manipulate in the Parliament that the threat to Kurdish people comes not only to from ISIS forces but also, even more importantly, from the Turkish government.</p>

<p>“Since Turkey is a member of NATO and our very close ally, we expect the British government to be making demands on the Turkish government about humanitarian aid, safe corridors, the movement of refugees, practical support of the Kurdish people,” he stated.</p>

<em>Jeremy Corbyn MP speaks to protesters</em></p>

<p>A 29-year-old Islington Councillor Aysegul Erdogan spoke to Corbyn on the side of the Kurdish delegation. “We know that Jeremy Corbyn was one of the MPs who said no to airstrikes in Iraq. But his approach to Kobane and our demands was different this time,” she said. According to Erdogan, MP Corbyn agreed to get answers from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on how the UK could help defeating ISIS in Kobane.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Our heart lies with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kobane?src=hash">#Kobane</a></p>&mdash; Aysegul Erdogan (@aysemeleti) <a href="https://twitter.com/aysemeleti/status/522176567880208384">October 15, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Corbyn’s speech, followed by a massive applause, finished with the words of encouragement stating that the common goal of political settlement in the whole Middle East region “must include the right of all the Kurdish people to self-determination regarding their own future, within or without existing national boarders.”</p>

<p>The position of the UK government on this issue remains unclear.</p>

<p>Update: on Tuesday, October 21, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/uk-drones-ready-to-attack-isis-in-syriaand-iraq-9807281.html">British aircraft has been readied for flights over Kobane to fight Isis in Syria</a>.</p>
