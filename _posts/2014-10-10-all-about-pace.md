I thought I knew something about Excel, but after our first data journalism workshop with John Burn-Murdoch, FT data journalist, I am not so sure. 

This was a small compliment to John, whom I am happy to see as our teacher, but the whole drama around this experience for me was in *the pace of learning*.

I considered myself quite a fast learner. Throughout my 3+ years at a cutting edge IT company, I had no other chance but be constantly learning new approaches and tools, since I wanted to pull myself into more and more interesting projects. Not a big deal to spend *a couple weeks* digging on the internet and learning by doing. In the end, I was able to introduce innovation, whilst many others tended to stick to what they already knew.

All in all, I was lucky enough to have my own tiny room in the office and could invest time into experimenting. How come? This is Minsk, baby. The competition is not high enough to push you not only to do cool things, but also do them *fast*.

Now, let's compare "a couple weeks" and "2 hours" in class - maybe, for the same amount of knowledge. My mind was simply puzzled.

**This compression of time is probably the best (and the hardest) thing about studying at City.**

Two years after I first encountered the term data journalism (and was immediately in love), I've done *some* data visualisations. I've even been invited to talks on data journalism in Minsk. Because omg I was one of the avantguard characters in local journalism. But I still struggle to parrot a chain of operations in Excel at a fast pace.

So is it me or it is a deceptive standard of success in the environment where I lived? Not like I was restricted to compare. I read industry news, attended international conferences. But there is no place like London that can show you so immediately what success means. It's when you are changing the world straight after you've started learning. Because even two hours matter, it's actually a massive amount of time to learn new things.

Update: Workshop #2 was much easier.
