As the Syrian city of Kobane retains its 34th day of resistance backed by US’s weapon airdrops and air strikes, Kurdish population in the UK continues to march with protests in London, demanding proper help from the British government.

Although the UK has joined International Coalition Against Islamic State and agreed to conduct air strikes over Iraq who have requested international help, the Parliament is reluctant to allow military operations over the territory of Syria ruled by a hostile President Bashar al-Assad.

The protesters chant “Wake up UK, wake up UK, terrorists are ISIS”, asking the UK government to influence Turkey whose silence they regard as support for ISIS. Kurds living in Turkey also protested, which led to severe clashes with the police. Kurdish population is a sensitive issue for Turkey because Turkey, US and EU consider Kurdish PKK a terrorist party. Thousands of refugees from Kobane are stuck at the Syrian-Turkish boarder with no way either back or forth.

Kurdish people also address civilian people in the UK in an attempt to raise their concern. “ISIS is growing and growing, today it is Kurdistan, tomorrow it can be London,” one of the protesters says. “Civilian people in Kobane are like in a prison, being attacked by ISIS from 3 sides and by Turkey on the other side. Women die, children have no food. So, I am here especially for Kobane, I only want everybody to hear our voice. Please, help us.”

A delegation of Kurds organised by the protesters arrange meetings with MPs across London to discuss the chances of convincing the Parliament to provide timely help. During one of the protest meeting at Parliament Square on October 14, the delegation talked to Jeremy Corbyn MP for North Islington who voted against joining anti-ISIS Coalition before ISIS strikes focused on Kobane. 

“We know that Jeremy Corbyn was one of the MPs who said no to airstrikes in Iraq against the ISIS. But his approach to Kobane and his approach to our demands was a bit different this time,” a 29-year-old London-based delegate Aysegul Erdogan said. According to her, MP Corbyn agreed to take this question to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and get answers to how the UK would intervene with defeating the ISIS in Kobane. The delegates asked to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Kobane and to provide armoury to YPG (People's Protection Units) guerilla fighters who defend the city.

In his open speech to protesters, Jeremy Corbyn said that he was trying to manipulate in the Parliament that the threat to Kurdish people comes not only to from ISIS forces but also, even more importantly, from the Turkish government. “Since Turkey is a member of NATO and a very close ally of the British government, we expect the British government to be making some demands on the Turkish government about humanitarian aid, safe corridors, movement of refugees, practical support of the Kurdish people,” he stated.  Corbyn assumed that other MPs would join this position.

A speech followed by a massive applause finished with the words of encouragement stating that the common goal of political settlement in the whole Middle East region “must include the right of all the Kurdish people to their self-determination, to decide their own future within or without existing national boarders”.

However, the position of the UK government on this issues remains unclear today.
