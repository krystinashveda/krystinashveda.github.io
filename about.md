Hello, World! My name is Krystina Shveda. I am half Belarusian half Ukrainian, 26 at the moment, normally based in Minsk.

My recent home however is City University London where I practice Interactive Journalism as a master student. Beforehand, I've worked in IT industry for 3.5 years doing anything from blogging to multimedia production to community management. But my deepest passion is Data Journalism and Visualisation. I also initiated a Hacks/Hackers Minsk community.

This blog was created to accumulate my experiences, publications, creative experiments and ideas.
