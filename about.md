_I am a fresh graduate of the notoriously stressful but very effective **City University London [MA in Interactive Journalism](http://www.interhacktives.com)**. Now I can write a long read in three days. And find stories in many dull rows of data. And come up with hybrid data analysis strategies that are easy enough to be implemented by a non-programmer but complex enough not "to lie with statistics"._

_If the above mentioned doesn't work, I have a wide network of friends in journalism and development across Europe ([see an example](http://bit.ly/1DhWh4S))._

###My favourite beat is...

 **Eastern European affairs**. I love telling stories of Belarusian and Ukrainian natives that will make you cry. [Like this one](http://bit.ly/Anna-Maidan).

 **Human rights activism ([like this](http://bit.ly/antifademo)), media ([like this](http://bit.ly/Buzzsocial)), social issues ([like this](http://bit.ly/nymbisfailed))** are the other topics that I enjoy covering as a journalist.

###My specialisation is...

 **online journalism**, with all the inevitable consequneces. 

 I adore everything geeky, from **statistical data analysis to scraping with Python to creating interactive visualisations to curating UGC**.

###I've worked in...

 **IT industry** for 3.5 years, and this was where I fell in love with the nerd culture. At EPAM, I was doing anything from **blogging to multimedia production to community management**.

 In London, I interned with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the MediaBriefing.

###Originally I am...

half Belarusian half Ukrainian. I used to live in Minsk but I am currently **based in London**.

###Back home...

 I was involved in organising [**Hacks/Hackers Minsk community**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackshackersminsk/).
